	title = {Designing Advance Market Commitments for New Vaccines},
	journal = {Working Paper},
	year = {2020},
	abstract = {\&nbsp;Abstract: Advance market commitments (AMCs) have been proposed as mechanisms to stimulate investment by suppliers of products to low-income countries, where familiar mechanisms such as patents and prizes can fall short. In an AMC, donors commit to a fund from which a specified subsidy is paid per unit purchased by low-income countries until the fund is exhausted, strengthening suppliers{\textquoteright} incentives to invest in research, development, and capacity. A \$1.5 billion pilot AMC was undertaken to speed the roll out of a pneumococcus vaccine to the developing world covering additional strains prevalent there.This paper undertakes the first formal analysis of AMCs. We construct a model in which an altruistic donor bargains with a supplier on behalf of a low-income country over vaccine price and quantity ex post, after the supplier has sunk ex ante investments. We use this model to explain the broad logic of an AMC{\textemdash}as a solution to a hold-up problem{\textemdash}as well as to analyze specific features of the pilot{\textquoteright}s design that we argue enhance its efficiency. We study a variety of design features including capacity forcing, supply commitments, price ceilings, and accrued interest, and consider a variety of economic environments including competing suppliers, competing demand from middle-income countries outside the program. We show that optimal AMC design differs markedly depending on where the product is in its development cycle.\&nbsp;},

 abstract = {State and local health departments investigate an increasing number of cluster allegations, for which the selection of appropriate statistical methods is an important problem. Many of the methods for the spatial analysis of health data assume, either implicitly or explicitly, some model of disease occurrence, and comparisons of methods can be difficult when their underlying disease models differ. We review some of the issues involved in the statistical analysis of spatial disease patterns and describe several methods recently proposed to detect areas of increased disease rates. The disease models upon which the methods are based are explicitly described, and they provide a useful basis for comparing alternative clustering methods.},
